Computers use binary - the digits 0 and 1 - to store data.

## Why use Base 2?

Binary math is way easier for a computer. Boolean logic maps easily to binary systems, with True and False being represented by on and off. Gates in your computer operate on boolean logic: they take two inputs and perform an operation on them like AND, OR, XOR, and so on. Two inputs are easy to manage.
